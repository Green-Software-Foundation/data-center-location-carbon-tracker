# Data Center Location Carbon Tracker

## Background
Most of cloud providers or on-premise data centers are providing carbon footprint of their services within their data centers, however, what is the missing is the energy sources and carbon tracking across the electricity generation grid. This repo combines the date input from given data center locations (e.g. Azure data centers or on-prem), emission data index and electricity grid boundaries (e.g. WattTime) to give a holistic view of carbon footprint in a data center location. The combined data set can be visalized in multiple ways. One example is to host with a map service. (e.g. Azure Map Service)

## Measurements

**Grid Emission Factor** refers to CO2 emission factor (tCO2/MWh) which will be associated with each unit of electricity provided by an electricity system.â€‹

**Marginal Operating Emissions Rate (MOER)** is a measurement in units of pounds of emissions per megawatt-hour (e.g. CO2 lbs/MWh), allowing to compare how marginal emissions rates vary by time and place by accurate marginal emissions analysis.
